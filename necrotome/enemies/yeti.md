Yetis (sometimes referred to within the community as "Klappas") are zone 3 enemies that are able to deal area-of-effect damage around them as they move.

A yeti will move every 4 beats, seeking towards the player. Whenever it moves, it will clap, dealing 1.5 hearts of damage to all players in a 3x3 square centred on the square it lands on. It can also directly attack a player standing directly next to it; in this case, they will not deal further area-of-effect damage to other players.

Yetis are able to dig through dirt and stone walls (equivalent to a titanium shovel). When digging, they will not deal damage around them.

The yeti has only 1 health point. When it dies, the square underneath the yeti will turn to ice, or water if it dies on top of hot coals.

Yetis are massive, and so are unaffected by traps.
