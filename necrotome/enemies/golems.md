# Golems <small><sub><sup>[Return](./)</sup></sub></small>
---
Golems are large, slow enemies that are able to deal large amounts of damage to the player. Zone 2 has Light Golems and Dark Golems, which behave similarly but with different health and damage, while zone 4 introduces the Ooze Golem (or "Goolem"), which is able to influence the terrain of the map.

All golems move once every four beats, seeking toward the player. What they lack in speed they make up for in health and damage, being able to take and deal a lot of pain. They all have the 'massive' attribute, making them immune to traps and floor hazards. They are all able to dig through walls with a strength of 2 (equivalent to a Titanium Shovel).

Ooze Golems are somewhat unique: the first time it is attacked by a player, it will cause a puddle of ooze to spawn under the player's feet (if the Amplified DLC is not installed, this will happen every time it is attacked). Unless the player has a set of boots that will protect them from this (Explorer's Boots, Lead Boots, Glass Slippers, or Boots of Levitation), Ooze will render a player unable to attack or dig, and cause them to take double damage from any hit.

Ooze Golems will trigger the spawning of ooze if they are damaged by a weapon or the Boots of Pain; they will not trigger this if hit by a spell, bomb, rat familiar or splash damage from the Ring of Pain.
