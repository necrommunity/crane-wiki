# Warlocks <small><sub><sup>[Return](./)</sup></sub></small>
---

Warlocks are a zone 4 enemy that moves directly towards the player every second beat. When killed by weapon damage, the player will teleport to the position of the warlock.

Teleporting does not activate on-movement effects (such as the Lute or Boots of Pain). Any items or coins that the warlock is standing on when it dies (including the coins it drops) will be teleported to the player's previous position. Traps are unaffected. In addition, items that the player is standing on during the teleport will not move. 

The teleportation happens immediately with the attack, so enemies will be able to attack you immediately after the teleport, any trap you land on will activate as normal, etc. Any player knockback from the Rifle or Blunderbuss will also happen after the teleport.

Warlocks will only teleport you if they die to damage from a weapon. This includes melee attacks, thrown daggers or spears, and bows or guns, but does not include damage from spells, bombs, familiars, or consumables such as Holy Water or Throwing Stars. In addition, a warlock will teleport you if they take damage from the Boots of Pain, but not from the Ring of Pain.
