# Mimics <small><sub><sup>[Return](./)</sup></sub></small>
---

Mimics disguise themselves as otherwise harmless objects to try to surprise the player. If you see something that should be immobile bobbing up and down to the beat as you approach, chances are good that it's a Mimic.

Mimics come in many types: barrels, crates, chests, shrines, dirt walls, shop walls, and cauldrons. All of them will remain stationary until the player moves directly next to them; after this, they will chase the player every beat until destroyed. Mimics cannot be destroyed on the same beat they are activated unless the player has a Dagger of Phasing.
All mimics have 1 health.

Crate and barrel mimics, when destroyed, will always give a single bomb for the player to pick up.

Chest mimics can be red, blue (locked) or white. Red and blue chest mimics chase the player like normal, while white chests will attempt to run away from the player as though feared. Chest mimics will drop an item from the item pool.

Shrine mimics always take the form of a Shrine of Darkness, and will typically drop a rare item when destroyed.

All of the mimics that can drop items (crate/barrel, chest, shrine) will drop their items if they die to a trap. If they fall down a trapdoor, the item will be visible for half a beat and can be "caught" by the player before it disappears. If it completely falls down the trapdoor, it will *not* be available on the following level.

Dirt wall mimics appear only in Zone 2, and take the appearance of a standard zone 2 dirt wall. Shop wall mimics are able to move diagonally, and will also activate if the player is adjacent to them diagonally.

Cauldron mimics appear in zone 3. When killed, they will drop hot coals or ice the same as their [Cauldron](./cauldrons) counterparts, and will drop gold in addition. Ice cauldron mimics are available in the level editor, but will not spawn during normal play.
