Clones are zone 2 enemies that take on the appearance of the player character and mirror their movements.

Whenever the player moves, the clone will move in the opposite direction to the player (e.g. if the player moves left, the clone will move to the right). Clones will move whenever the player does, including on movement-based actions such as when using rapiers, axes, the ring of courage or shovel of courage. If the player makes a directional input but doesn't move (stationary attacking or digging), clones will not move. They also ignore any movement that is not caused by a player input (such as skeleton mages and traps), and will only move once per beat even if the player moves more than one square (e.g. Boots of Leaping, or an axe lunge with a ring of courage).

If the player is knocked back due to using a rifle or blunderbuss, the clone will move in the opposite direction to the knockback. A clone affected by confusion will move in the same direction as the player; a clone affected by fear will ignore the player's input and simply try to run away similar to other enemies.

If a clone tries to move onto the same square as the player, it will attack them for 1.5 hearts of damage. If the clone comes into contact with any other object, it will bump against it without attempting to dig.
Clones are fully affected by water and tar; if it falls into one of these, its next attempted movement will be spent climbing out of the hazard.

In co-op gameplay, clones will only respond to player 1's controls. Diamond's clones are able to move diagonally, while Dorian's clones will only move one square at a time regardless of whether his boots are activated.
