Cauldrons <small><sub><sup>[Return](./)</sup></sub></small>
---

Cauldrons appear in zone 3. They are completely immobile, but unlike crates they are considered to be enemies for attack targeting purposes.

Cauldrons have 1 health, and when destroyed will leave behind a tile of hot coals. They will not drop any gold, even if the player is holding a golden weapon, but will still drop coins for Monk or Coda.
Cauldrons cannot be moved, even by knockback attacks such as Eli's shovel hand.

Ice cauldrons also exist in the level editor, but will not spawn during normal play. These are identical to regular cauldrons, except that they drop ice instead of hot coals. 

If you see a cauldron that appears to be moving as you approach it, it's probably a [Mimic](./mimics).
