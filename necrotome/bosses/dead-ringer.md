# Dead Ringer <small><sub><sup>[Return](./)</sup></sub></small>
---
Dead Ringer is the 1st of 2 story bosses for Cadence, appearing at the end of zone 5.  The boss room is an 11x10 tile space, with [sarcophogi](../enemies/sarcophagi) in the top left and right corners.  4 bells are placed within the room; 2 placed 3 tiles in from either wall and 2 tiles from the bottom, and 2 more bells placed 3 tiles in from either wall and 4 tiles from the top.  Once all 4 bells have either been rung or destroyed, Dead Ringer enters his 2nd stage and a gong will appear in the centre of a 3 tile wide enclave at the top of the arena.  Having Dead Ringer strike the gong is one of 2 win conditions for the boss.

Dead Ringer is one of the most complex bosses in the game, and the community has developed many different strategies for it.  Over the years since his introduction, the community has put together multiple strats for safely and quickly dealing with him.  For the rest of this guide, we'll refer to the bells as:
  1) TL = Top left
  2) TR = Top right
  3) BL = Bottom left
  4) BR = Bottom right

## Strategies
---
### Luring
Luring Dead Ringer is generally the safest way to beat the fight, but the tradeoff is speed, especially versus other strats.  You should use lures when you have a healthy lead heading into the fight.

#### Right side (DR spawns left side)
###### [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Ly6x5amGA&t=56) by Grimy
1. Start on the left most tile, and lure DR to the bottom of the level.
2. Move to the left of the BR bell and lure DR to break it.
3. Do the same for the BL and TL bells, moving to the right and under each of the bells respectively.
4. Lure DR into the TR bell, and buffer on the tile under the gong until the second phase activates.
5. Move out of DR's path (be careful about enemies blocking your path)

#### Left side (DR spawns right side)
###### [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0Ly6x5amGA) by Grimy
1. Start on the left most tile, and hit the BL bell from the top tile.
2. Move straight up to the TL bell, and hit it from the top tile. (if the ogre doesn't block DR, you aren't going to the BL bell fast enough)
3. Move diagonally to the tile under the gong, and move out of DR's path.

### Japanese strat
###### [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjK1oEm8MY8) by crash2455</small>
Developed by the Japanese community, this strat is faster but less safe than the standard luring as some skeleton spawns can ruin it.

1. Start on the left most tile and head towards the top tile of the BL bell. Be sure to move straight up twice to avoid luring DR to the bottom of the stage.
2. Hit the bell at the same time as DR hits the TL, and move right toward the BR bell as DR moves downward.
3. Hit the BR bell from the top, and move up to hit the TR bell from the bottom.
4. Move left to lure DR towards the gong.

### Oblivion strat
###### [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9reINxktx4&t=47s) by crash2455

Use for left spawn, straight attack or move + attack weapons < 3 damage

1. Start from the right most tile and move diagonally to the BR bell. Hit it from the left tile. 
2. Move left and hit the BL bell from the top tile.
3. Move left, up twice, and then diagonally towards the gong, ignoring all damage.
4. After dodging the minotaur, move up to lure DR into the gong.

If you have a broadsword, please see this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZkAu2SBSfQ) for a slight revision on the Oblivion strat.

### Flail strat
###### [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecLiJnxDVgw) by Staekk
Developed by Staekk, specifically for flails.

1. Start from the center tile, move 2 tiles up and hit the BR bell from the left. 
2. Move left and hit the BL bell from the right.
3. Move right to the center of the stage, and move up from the center.
4. When DR is 1 tile above you, hit him with the flail to knock him into the gong.

### Cat strat
###### [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6N5UxyujGOM) by Staekk
Developed by Staekk, specifically for cats.  This strat only works when Dead Ringer spawns on the left side of the arena.

1. Start from the center tile and hit the BR bell on the bottom tile.
2. Kill the minotaur, and move left to hit the BL bell on the right tile.
3. Move diagonally, then up on the center tile, hitting DR against the ogre, then lure him into the gong.

### Staff strat

#### Right side (DR spawns left side)
###### [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlbRsjhWkJ0) by Grimy

1. Start from the left most tile, and move to the left of the BL bell. Hit it, activating both the BL and BR bells.
2. Move up to the TL bell aligned with the row, hit the TL bell from the bottom and lure DR to the left side on the row under the TL bell. 
3. Move right, lure DR into the ogre and then lure him into the gong.

#### Left side (DR spawns right side)
###### [Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayiaDlB2TpQ) by Grimy

1. Start on the right most tile, and hit the BR bell from the bottom, activating both the TR and BR bells.
2. Move to the right side of the BR bell and hit it to activate the BL one.
3. Move to the left, then up on the center row to lure DR into the gong.

### Damaging Dead Ringer
It is possible to beat Dead Ringer without ringing any of the bells, or the gong - he is able to be damaged by any mechanic that would normally deal infinite damage, or by being hit with an attack (melee, spell, or item) that deals 10 damage or more. These include:

1. Pulse scroll, or Pulse spell with Ring of Mana
2. Earth tome/spell, by crushing him against a wall, bell, enemy, or whilst frozen
3. Frost dagger whilst frozen (Frost charm, Freeze scroll/tome/spell or Ice Spirit familiar)
4. Phasing dagger
5. Earthquake scroll (Use this to open the doors to the fight too!)
6. Blood Drum
7. Any blood weapon while on 0.5 heart
8. Any gold weapon (using its infinite damage mechanic)

By doing so Dead Ringer will be in his 2nd stage immediately and can either be damaged a second time using any of the methods above or lured into the gong.  
Damaging him preemptively is usually faster and more consistent than any of the other strategies.
