### In-game settings
We require racers to stream in the native windowed resolution of the game, or a multiple thereof.  NecroDancer runs at 480x270, so acceptable resolutions and zoom levels are:
|Resolution|Zoom level|
|---|---|
|960x540|2x|
|1440x810|3x|
|1920x1080|4x|
*Note: Please be aware that if you play in Windowed mode with a window size of 1920x1080, and you have maximised the window, you will be unable to see Dead Ringer from the doors of the room.  We recommend that you either play in Fullscreen mode, or reduce your window size.*  

Additionally, please ensure your settings under Gameplay Options match the following:
|Setting|Value|
|---|---|
|Boss intros|Enabled|
|Cutscenes|Disabled|
|Enemy hearts|Disabled|
|Item names|Disabled|
|Item hints|Disabled|

### Stream settings
We ask that racers stream at a bitrate no higher than 1500Kb/s, and a resolution no higher than 720p, at either 30fps or 60fps.  You can find pre-made profiles that may suit your needs if you are new to streaming by [clicking here](https://condor.live/profiles).  The settings for these profiles are below:
|Name|Bitrate (Kb/s)|Resolution|Encoder preset|
|---|---|---|---|
|Low|500|640x360|`superfast`|
|Medium|750|852x480|`veryfast`|
|High|1000|852x480|`veryfast`|

The pre-made profiles are only intended to be a starting point, further tweaking may be required to achieve the stability and quality wanted/required.  If you are unsure of what settings to use, please refer to the below video: (coming soon)
