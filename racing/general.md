You can think of racing COTND as a spectrum between speedrunning and deathless:

- At the top levels, racing resembles speedrunning. Sometimes you just have to grab a glass item and push, push, push.
- At the lower levels, racing can just be a deathless grind. You and your opponent might struggle to survive, so grabbing a comfortable build and aiming to finish at all can get you the win.

Racing is about finding the balance - you will lose if you go too slowly, but you will also lose if you go too recklessly and die.

It's also a competition against another player, not the clock. If you're playing a better opponent, you may need to play less safe than you otherwise would in order to put pressure on them; if you can put pressure on them, maybe they'll make a mistake, or even luckier, die.

{{anchor "switchspeed"}}_If You're Switching from Speedrunning to Racing:_ You may need to slow down your game in order to ensure that you finish - if you're speedrunning, you can just reset, but if you die in a race, you're probably screwed. Some tips:

- Play safer with enemies early on. Taking an extra beat or two to kill an enemy behind you or pick your way safely through a swarm will cost you less than having to make a panicked retreat or worse, dying. Once you've got your build together you can start being a little more Rambo.
- Occasionally check shops, especially when one of the following is true:
  - The shop is very close and you've enough money on you for a key item
  - You have the equipment for a [shopkeeper kill]
- Take the boss gold. You'll be glad you did when you pass a [Conjurer] or a [Shrine of Chance] and can dump it into a great build quickly.
- Take the time to kill the [Leprechaun] the first chance you get. Between bat protection, [Shrine of Chance], and [Ham]/triple [Bomb]  crates, acquiring a [Lucky Charm] is worth the extra beats. (And of course, once you have the charm and the means to do so, also take the time to open crates and barrels.) 
- Always check the flawless boss chest, unless you know you're way behind and need to push super-hard.
- Don't take items you aren’t comfortable with. Sure, [Miner’s Cap] [Boots of Leaping] [Glass Cat] [Karate Gi] is fast, but if you can’t reliably finish a run with it, you're not going to win.

{{anchor "switchdeath"}}_If You're Switching from Deathless to Racing:_ On the other hand, you may just be trying to finish, but faster than normal. If "reckless" is not your problem:

- Focus on making quick decisions. Obsessing over [Crown of Thorns] vs. [Blast Helm] for 20 seconds is a time suck. Pick one and get on with your run.
- Don't go too far out of your way for things. Shops, in particular, but if you're a deathless player you probably have a few habits like picking up gold and killing slimes out of spite that will cost you a lot of time over a run. Remember - you have a lot of levels to make a build, and best build doesn't win. Your goal is the next floor.
- You're not going to have time to farm, so look for critical items. Value armor; fill out your build at a [Conjurer] or a [Food Shop].
